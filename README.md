🧠 Jarvis - AI Voice Assistant using Python
Jarvis is an advanced AI-powered virtual assistant built in Python. It uses speech recognition, text-to-speech, deep learning (NLP), and system automation to understand user commands and perform a wide range of tasks — just like a mini Jarvis from Iron Man.

📌 Features
✅ Understands voice and text commands
✅ Speaks responses using TTS
✅ Tells date and time
✅ Opens/closes apps like Notepad, Chrome, VS Code
✅ YouTube and Google search automation
✅ Tells jokes and responds to appreciation
✅ Intent detection using a trained neural network (chat_model.h5)
✅ Context-aware responses from intents.json
✅ Friendly conversational replies
✅ Easily expandable with more commands
